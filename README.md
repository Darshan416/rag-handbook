# rag-handbook

📘 The ultimate handbook for understanding and building RAG systems.

A complete handbook on building **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems — from foundational concepts to architecture design, evaluation techniques, and real-world optimization strategies.

> Learn how to make LLMs *grounded, factual, and scalable* through Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

## 📘 What You'll Learn

* What **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is and why it matters
* How retrieval enhances **LLM accuracy and reduces hallucination**
* Core components of a RAG system — **retriever, vector database, and generator**
* How to build an **end-to-end RAG pipeline** conceptually
* Evaluation, tuning, and production best practices

---

## 🏗️ Why This Handbook

Most RAG tutorials focus on code — this one focuses on **understanding** .

If you want to *really grasp* how RAG systems work before writing a single line of code, this handbook is for you.

You’ll learn the **theory, trade-offs, and design principles** behind every stage, preparing you to confidently build or evaluate production-grade RAG systems later.

---

## 🧩 Ideal For

* AI engineers & data scientists learning RAG
* Anyone curious about how **retrieval + generation** work together
